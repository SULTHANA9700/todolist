1.	Component Initialization:
•	The code begins by importing necessary dependencies such as React and Bootstrap components.
•	It defines a class component named App that extends Component from React.
2.	State Initialization:
•	In the constructor, the initial state of the component is set up.
•	userInput is initialized to an empty string, representing the input field where users can type their TODO items.
•	list is initialized as an empty array, where the TODO items will be stored.
3.	State Management Methods:
•	updateInput(value): Updates the userInput state as the user types in the input field.
•	addItem(): Adds a new TODO item to the list if the input is not empty.
•	deleteItem(key): Deletes a TODO item from the list based on its unique id.
•	editItem(index): Allows the user to edit a TODO item. It prompts the user for a new value, updates the item, and sets the state accordingly.
4.	Rendering UI:
•	The render() method returns the JSX code that represents the UI of the TODO list application.
•	It uses Bootstrap's grid system (Container, Row, and Col) for layout.
•	It renders an input field where users can type their TODO items and a button to add them to the list.
•	The list of TODO items is displayed using Bootstrap's ListGroup component.
•	Each TODO item is rendered as a ListGroup.Item, which includes the item's value along with buttons for deleting and editing the item.
5.	Event Handling:
•	Event handlers like onChange, onClick are attached to various UI elements to handle user interactions.
•	These event handlers call the corresponding methods defined in the component to update the state and manage the list of TODO items.
6.	Bootstrap Styling:
•	Bootstrap classes are used to style different elements of the UI, such as input fields, buttons, and list items.
•	This provides a clean and responsive layout for the TODO list application without writing custom CSS.
Overall, the App component encapsulates the functionality of a basic TODO list application, managing state, handling user interactions, and rendering the UI using React and Bootstrap components.
